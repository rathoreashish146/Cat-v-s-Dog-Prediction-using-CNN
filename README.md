# Cat v/s Dog Prediction using CNN

## Introduction
Cat v/s Dog Prediction using CNN is a project that focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project aims to develop a robust model that can accurately differentiate between images of cats and dogs.

## Features
- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
- Trains the model on a large dataset of labeled images of cats and dogs.
- Performs image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- Implements deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the CNN model.
- Evaluates the model's accuracy and performance using a separate test dataset.
- Enables accurate prediction of whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. Download the labeled dataset of cat and dog images for training and testing.
4. Preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them, if desired.
5. Train the CNN model on the labeled dataset using the provided training script.
6. Evaluate the trained model using a separate test dataset to measure its accuracy.
7. Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen images of cats or dogs.

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset of labeled cat and dog images in the required format.
2. Modify the configuration settings in the training script to suit your needs.
3. Run the training script to train the CNN model on the labeled dataset.
4. After training, use the provided testing script to evaluate the model's performance.
5. Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions on new images.
6. Modify the prediction script to load the trained model and predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.
7. Execute the prediction script on new, unseen images to obtain predictions.
